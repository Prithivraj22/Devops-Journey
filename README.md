This repository is a daily log of my journey learning DevOps. It includes notes, explanations, examples, and command references for key technologies like Docker, GitHub Actions, AWS, Kubernetes, and more. My goal is to document everything I learn, step by step, while building real-world DevOps pipelines and mastering modern infrastructure tools.

## Topics Covered
- Docker (Basics to Advanced)
- CI/CD Pipelines (GitHub Actions)
